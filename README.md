# Gat201homology_2022

This repository is supplementary data accompanying the bioRxiv preprint:

> A trade-off between proliferation and defense in the fungal pathogen Cryptococcus at alkaline pH is controlled by the transcription factor GAT201.
> Elizabeth S. Hughes, Zhenzhen He, Elizabeth R. Ballou, Edward W.J. Wallace.

The repository contains only an analysis of homology of Cryptococcus neoformans Gat201 and related GATA-family transcription factors.
Including domain analysis, multiple sequence alignment of the shared GATA zinc-finger domain, and figures.

## Homologous Proteins included here

* Cryptococcus neoformans Gat201, CNAG_01551
* Ustilago maydis UMAG_04076
* Neurospora crassa sub-1
* Aspergillus fumigatus NsdD
* Candida albicans Brg1

## TO DO NEXT

- convert PANTHER IDs to uniprot IDs or something
- download domain info
- check domain structure, filter to fungal homologs with same domain
- compute MSA of filtered list
- construct phylogenetic tree
- make a figure of domain structure for select homologs
- make a figure of GATA domain MSA for select homologs
